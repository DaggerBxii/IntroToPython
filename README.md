### Python

There are several development environments to choose from, but Visual Studio Code is one of the most popular. The latest instructions can be found here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

You will need:

- Python 3 installed on your machine
- Python extension in Visual Studio Code
- (For the tutorial pages) Jupyter extension for Visual Studio Code. Github will allow you to view the files in the repository but not run the code blocks.
